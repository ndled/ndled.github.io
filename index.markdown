| ![alt text](me.jpg) | I'm Noah and I work at [Alegion](https://www.alegion.com/) doing lots of different stuff. I like math generally, statistics specifically, data, and education.


Ex Teacher turned Data Engineer. I mostly write about personal projects, cool things I'm learning, or what I'm currently reading.
