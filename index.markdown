| ![alt text](me.jpg) | I'm Noah and I work at [Alegion](https://www.alegion.com/) doing lots of different stuff. I like math generally, statistics specifically, data, and education.


I am pretty fresh into a career switch away from education over into a more data focused path. I mostly write about how weird that is... Other times I write about what I'm reading or what's a cool thing I just learned.
