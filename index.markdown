| ![alt text](me.jpg) | I'm Noah and I'm looking for a job. I like math generally, statistics specifically, data, and even education. Sometimes.


After working with high schoolers and their educators, I excel at building long-term trust on diverse teams in project-based settings. Iâ€™m looking for a place that fosters growth and where I can learn and apply new statistical skills in industry.
